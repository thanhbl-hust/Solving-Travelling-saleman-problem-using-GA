## How can i do this project

We try to solve TSP with 4 alogrithms:
- `Branch and Bound`: Using Branch and Bound to prunne unnecessary branches, optimize algorithm running time.

- `Nearest Neighbor (NN)`: NN is a finding algorithm. The idea of algorithm is to build a route by choosing the nearest unvisited city as the next city.
So we will N cases (N is the number of cities of problem).
  * Pos: Very good run time, easy to code.
  * Neg: Not suitable to find the optimal solution. It should only be installed to be able to compare results with other algorithms.
- `Genetic Algorithm (GA)`: Inspired by Darwin's theory of evolution. In this algorithm, we have to use some steps like in biological process to improve the solutions:
  * `Crorssover`
  * `Mutation`
  * `Selecting individual`

- `Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)`: ACO gets its idea from the foraging process of ants.
With each path-finding process, each ant will leave a trace, called a `pheromone`, that affects the path decisions of subsequent generations.
